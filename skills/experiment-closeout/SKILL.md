# Experiment Closeout

Every experiment ends with a code-retention decision. Do not let failed or inconclusive changes silently leak into the next run.

## Workflow Integration

Before stage-specific closeout:

1. Read `../_shared/workflow-protocol.md`.
2. Resolve or create the active workflow in the current project root.
3. Read `workflow.json`, result notes, prior stage summaries, and recorded start-state metadata.
4. Reuse saved experiment metadata instead of asking the user to paste it again.

This stage writes:

- `docs/experiments/results/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- `.superpowers/workflows/<workflow_id>/stages/experiment-closeout.md`
- `.superpowers/workflows/<workflow_id>/final-summary.md`
- updated `workflow.json`

## Start-State Requirement

Before the first experiment-specific code change, record:

- start commit
- branch name
- whether the working tree was clean
- expected files or configs the experiment will touch

If the tree was already dirty, isolate the experiment on a branch or record the exact touched-file list. Do not use destructive rollback that could wipe unrelated work.

## Workflow

1. Gather the outcome:
   - result summary
   - artifacts
   - experiment start-state metadata
   - saved result figures, if any
2. Ask the user explicitly:
   - keep the code changes
   - discard the code changes
   - pause the decision
3. Write or update the experiment note in `docs/experiments/results/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.
4. Reuse saved figures from `workflow.json.artifacts.result_figures` in the note and final summary instead of regenerating them unless new evidence appears.
5. For negative or inconclusive outcomes, make sure the note includes:
   - hypothesis
   - exact intervention
   - baseline used
   - metrics and artifacts
   - why the result is considered failed, flat, or unreliable
   - `do not repeat unless ...`
6. If the user chooses `keep`:
   - leave the code in place
   - record that retention decision in the note
   - the next `workflow summary` may reuse that decision to offer branch and commit handoff
   - use `reproducibility-check` before making a performance claim
7. If the user chooses `discard`:
   - write the note first
   - preserve result notes and saved figures
   - revert experiment changes to the recorded start state
   - if the experiment began from a clean tree, restore or reset to the start commit
   - if the experiment began from a dirty tree, restore only the experiment-touched files
   - verify the post-revert git state before moving on
8. Report three things:
   - whether code was kept or discarded
   - where the experiment note lives
   - what state the workspace is now in
9. Update `workflow.json` with `retention_decision`, `workspace_state`, `result_note_path`, and `final_summary_seed`.
10. Refresh `final-summary.md` using `../_shared/final-summary-template.md`.

## Exit State

- `current_stage=experiment-closeout`
- `next_stage=reproducibility-check` only when the result is still claimable
- otherwise `next_stage=none`
- `status=closed` unless reproducibility work is still pending
- include the exact continue phrase `continue current workflow`

## Guardrails

- Never delete failed-experiment evidence just because code is discarded.
- Never delete saved figures that explain a failed or inconclusive experiment.
- Never revert before the failed experiment is documented.
- Never assume failed changes should be kept or discarded; ask.
- Never use a destructive rollback if unrelated changes existed before the experiment started.
