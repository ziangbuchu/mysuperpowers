# Paper To Implementation

Separate what the paper actually contributes from what its codebase or benchmark setup happened to do.

## Workflow Integration

Before stage-specific analysis:

1. Read `../_shared/workflow-protocol.md`.
2. Resolve or create the active workflow in the current project root.
3. Read `workflow.json`, prior stage summaries, and any existing paper notes.
4. Reuse saved context instead of asking the user to restate the paper or local baseline.

This stage writes:

- `.superpowers/workflows/<workflow_id>/stages/paper-to-implementation.md`
- updated `workflow.json`

## Workflow

1. Extract the paper's core intervention:
   - model change
   - loss change
   - data or augmentation change
   - training schedule change
   - evaluation change
2. Identify hidden assumptions:
   - dataset scale
   - pretraining
   - extra filtering
   - compute budget
   - ensemble or post-processing
3. Map the intervention into the current codebase.
4. Define the smallest faithful reproduction.
5. Define an ablation ladder:
   - reproduction
   - simplified local version
   - one-at-a-time ablations
6. Update `workflow.json` with `core_intervention`, `hidden_assumptions`, `local_mapping`, `minimal_reproduction`, and `ablation_ladder`.
7. Write the stage summary using `../_shared/stage-summary-template.md`.
8. Hand off to `experiment-design`.

## Exit State

- `current_stage=paper-to-implementation`
- `next_stage=experiment-design`
- `status=active`
- include the exact continue phrase `continue current workflow`

## Guardrails

- Do not merge multiple paper ideas into one first attempt.
- Do not copy reported numbers without matching their protocol.
- If the paper's gains depend on infrastructure you do not have, state that early.
