# Experiment Design

Turn a rough research idea into a falsifiable experiment plan before writing code.

## Workflow Integration

Before stage-specific reasoning:

1. Read `../_shared/workflow-protocol.md`.
2. Resolve or create the active workflow in the current project root.
3. Read `workflow.json`, prior stage summaries, and any existing spec linked from workflow state.
4. Reuse saved context instead of asking the user to restate it.

This stage writes:

- `docs/experiments/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- `.superpowers/workflows/<workflow_id>/stages/experiment-design.md`
- updated `workflow.json`

## Hard Gate

Do not change code, configs, or launch runs until these are clear:

- hypothesis
- baseline
- success metric
- dataset and split
- compute budget

## Workflow

1. Inspect the current baseline: code path, configs, last known results, open uncertainties.
2. Ask clarifying questions one at a time.
3. State the hypothesis in one sentence: "If we change X, metric Y should improve because Z."
4. Propose 2-3 approaches and recommend one.
5. Define the first experiment as the smallest test that could disprove the idea.
6. Write an experiment card to `docs/experiments/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.
7. Update `workflow.json` with `hypothesis`, `baseline`, `metric`, `dataset_split`, `budget`, `first_falsifier`, and `approval_required=true`.
8. Write the stage summary using `../_shared/stage-summary-template.md`.
9. Stop for explicit user approval before moving to `experiment-planning`.

## Exit State

- `current_stage=experiment-design`
- `next_stage=experiment-planning`
- `status=awaiting_approval`
- include the exact continue phrase `continue current workflow`

## Experiment Card

Every design doc should include:

- goal
- baseline to beat
- exact metric and selection rule
- train/val/test or benchmark split assumptions
- minimal code/config changes expected
- sanity checks before full training
- failure modes and what evidence would invalidate the idea
- next decision after the first run

## Guardrails

- Do not hide evaluation changes inside modeling changes.
- Do not compare against a weak or mismatched baseline.
- Do not treat one lucky run as evidence.
- If the idea touches multiple subsystems, split it into separate experiments.
