# Experiment Planning

Convert an approved experiment design into an execution plan that another researcher could follow without guessing.

## Workflow Integration

Before stage-specific planning:

1. Read `../_shared/workflow-protocol.md`.
2. Resolve or create the active workflow in the current project root.
3. Read `workflow.json`, the current spec, prior stage summaries, and any referenced artifacts.
4. If design approval is still pending, stop and surface that approval gate instead of planning. In Codex, re-issue the approval request with `ask_user`.

This stage writes:

- `docs/experiments/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- `.superpowers/workflows/<workflow_id>/stages/experiment-planning.md`
- updated `workflow.json`

## Output

Save the plan to `docs/experiments/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.

## Plan Structure

Start every plan with:

```markdown
# [Topic] Experiment Plan

**Goal:** [What hypothesis this plan tests]

**Baseline:** [Exact run, config, or checkpoint to compare against]

**Primary Metric:** [Metric and selection rule]

**Budget:** [GPUs, wall-clock, run count]

## Workflow

1. Map the files, configs, scripts, and launch commands involved.
2. Break the work into small steps:
   - code change
   - static or unit check
   - tiny sanity run
   - full run
   - result collection
3. For each step, include exact file paths and exact commands.
4. Define what artifacts must be saved: config, seed, commit, checkpoint, logs, metrics table.
5. Call out rollback criteria and stop conditions.
6. Update `workflow.json` with `change_set`, `sanity_checks`, `run_matrix`, `artifact_requirements`, and `stop_conditions`.
7. Write the stage summary using `../_shared/stage-summary-template.md`.
8. Hand execution to `experiment-execution`.

## Exit State

- `current_stage=experiment-planning`
- `next_stage=experiment-execution`
- `status=active`
- include the exact continue phrase `continue current workflow`

## Good Planning Rules

- Prefer one hypothesis per plan.
- Keep evaluation fixed unless the plan is specifically about evaluation.
- Include a "small-data / few-step sanity run" before expensive training.
- Separate infrastructure refactors from scientific questions whenever possible.
